    - In **.eslintrc.js**
        - Add
            ```
            "env": {
                "node": true
            }
            ```
        - Add
            ```
            "extends": {
                "plugin:@next/next/recommended"
            }
            ```
        - Add
            ```
            "settings": {
                "react": {
                    "version": "17.0"
                }
            }
            ```
        - Add
            ```
            "rules": {
                "object-curly-spacing": ["warn", "always"],
                "react/jsx-key": "off"
            }
            ```
    - Remove existing **.eslintrc.json**

3. Fix template files for linter

    - Reindent files from 2 to 4 spaces
    - Change quotes from single to double
    - Add `import React from "react"` to all TSX files
    - Check linting with `yarn lint`

4. Install and configure Tailwind

    ```
    yarn add tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer @tailwindcss/forms
    yarn run tailwindcss init
    ```

    - Remove `styles/Home.module.css` and its import in `pages/index.tsx`
    - Replace `styles/globals.css` with Tailwind setup:

        ```
        @tailwind base;
        @tailwind components;
        @tailwind utilities;
        ```

    - Create `tailwind.config.js` according to https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs
    - Add plugin `@tailwindcss/forms` to `tailwind.config.js`
    - In **tailwind.config.js** add
        ```
        plugins: [
            require("@tailwindcss/forms")
        ]
        ```
    - Remove `className={...}` from `pages/index.tsx`
    - Set Tailwind classNames in `pages/index.tsx` to match original boilerplate

5. Config PostCSS
    - Create `postcss.config.js` and add the following:
        ```
        module.exports = {
            plugins: {
                tailwindcss: {},
                autoprefixer: {},
            },
        }
        ```
